This plugin will copy or delete a bbPress install from one multisite to another.

== Description ==

Move bbPress Multisite allows to move a bbpress install from 1 website of a WordPress Network, to another website of the same MultiSite Network.

You can select which parts of your bbPress install to copy and you can also select what parts to delete from the original website.

We used it to move 66 Forums, 17,353 Topics and 97,371 Replies of the bbPress powered support forum of our website https://wpgeodirectory.com to separate the support forum from the pages dedicated to promote and sell our products.

Moving the forum into its own website within the multisite network allowed the main website to load 50% faster.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Network Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. That's it you can now access the plugin under the bbPress move menu item.
